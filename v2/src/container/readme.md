# Container

the container maintains an interface to a local or remote VOL utilising a special driver for local digestion

The container runs as a self hosted web view with a local service decoding a stream from one or more VOLs to render in the live view.


# Ocipital Cortex

The occipital lobe is the visual processing center. The cortex is the outer surface of the cerebrum and is composed of gray matter. The motor areas are located in both hemispheres of the cerebral cortex.

The Ocipital Cortex is a topological view of the interior information, presented though data streams to a visual pipeline - abstracted and rendered through a visual container.
