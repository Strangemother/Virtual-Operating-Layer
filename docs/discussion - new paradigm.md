# Discussion

For a moment let's forget the title and style our personal vision of a dream computer. In general I'm talking about the interface and how a user will provide input to yield a result. For a digression into my goals as an end-user I feel a quick insight to the driving concept helps colour the idea of a brand-new paradigm.

Hopefully I'm not one for hyperbole and I don't wish to con the user (or reader) through a restyle of current societal patterns. Instead I wish to fundamentally delete the paradigm of todays computing  topology and press reset on all architecture we hold today as fundamental. I don't mean literally; that's idiotic - but it's a fun thought experiment.

Initially we start with? .. It's a big question to answer 'everything' where the answer is "no that's fine tbh." as the context is so-far two paragraphs of marketing speak. So building an operating system provides unprecedented insight to the clockwork of a computer. And in all honesty it kinda makes sense. Bit and bytes into the CPU -> spit numbers -> render. Reading this you're already aware of a CPU so I won't continue.

It's been like this since near the 60's. And very honestly the same code from the 70's is running (a more than I thought) some of your OS right now. Core ideas from a hippy suite in a Xerox cubical though "hmm. maybe _stdout_?" and noted it down. Perhaps even an `int` has humble origins.

Your silly core 40 htz Intel CPU thing is crazy powerful. It can run a space-station and GTA without sneezing. It can even run pre-dinosaur 16bit atari things without stepping into 32bit protected mode. Through the pace of modern tech we lessen the ability with each Moors step. I'd consider an AMD 1.2Ghz Athlon X2 no better than a decorative trinket.

Why? Because the stuff we do is hard as shit to compute. Text!? Literal Font files and their rendering is so complex no wonder my poor Pi device chokes. If today we could remake all hardware: CPU, RAM, Binary, Electons... MOSFETS - what would we have? Better ideas on paper...


## The interface

Text?


## RAM

Stuff is binary. That's that. Initially I was unaware of something magical called 'ternary' or binary + 1, `0, 1, 2`. Three bits to a base value instead of two! Absolute madness! until you read how it works.

Further reading noted the humble MOSFET is essentially a ternary logic gate. We just never continued


## CPU

The CPU currently manages all sorts of crazy - includes three distinct counting abilities; namely 16, 32 and 64 bit management. In addition to its own suite of work, cycles are dedicated to internal management and whatever else it happens to compute - an OS for example.
