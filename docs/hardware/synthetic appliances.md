## Definition

The deifnition of this service harks back to the 70's and the original research leading to todays UNIX environment. During this time it was the wild-west for core development whereas today we have standards and for everything, during the 70's they were still inventing the wheel.

As such all the work here isn't new and much still exists today - albeit quietly.

Hi

I was listening to your stuff and completely blown by your awesomeness.

Our dev studio are making a game, and I would sincerely love if we could use a track made by you as a in-game track. It'll play in the background as a predominant track (the entry metal song).


Due to my hast in communicating, I probably don't have a spec for you - I can tell you our overview, and my inspirations - other to that, I'm happy for you to do whatever you feel sounds great.

Is that something you're willing to do?

Thanks in advance

Ha no problem mate, this project is a slow-burner. It's great to hear you'd consider this.

It's a 3D game in which you and fly a vehicle. Atompunk is the style, with Heavy metal tracks.

1. Generally a player will likely fly around in the clouds or space.
2. The game visual is "atompunk"/"solarpunk"
3. The track will be used as an in-game track - hopefully to _present_ a new city scene.

Legit think of heavy metal Jetsons?

We'd love a heavy metal track to accent the introduction to the first entered scene.

1. Less than 2 minutes
2. A solo would be awesome
3. The overall theme is Space/atompunk/solarpunk

I can provide a range of songs we like - as inspiration for the direction if it helps.



Hi Adam


We're building a game with in-game _lore_ and tutorials in the form of 1940\~1950 animated educational videos. The content will present pretend science (anti grav vehicles.)

You're voice is perfect for the style and I was hoping may be able to imitate that _1950's voiceover_ synonymous with the period feeling.

Is that something you'd be happy to do? We'd provide a script and do any sound effects.

+ A voiceover for in-game training and history presentations
+ In the style of 1950's educational videos

Here's a bunch of examples - the first is pretty much the sound we're going for.
