# A Geode

The Graph layer acts as a service, connecting bit instructions to the byte connections - a service may subscribe to the graph, request a chain and asynchronously digest the results. The input service can receive formatted requests, denoting actions upon the graph - such as "read", "write", "open for edit" etc. The methodology is a facsimile of the standard computing model, and these methods (their name and actions) wont exist or work in the same manner.

# Graph Input Output Disk Emulator => "GIODE"

The name is both an attempt at a clever acronym and happy accident with the overall philosophy. The Graph layer acts as an interpreter to the graph db to common operation bytes. The Emulator will pretend to be a standard storage medium to the HOST, but access as a graph through VOL. Additional methods allow _standard_ throughput.

> A Geode: a geological secondary formation within sedimentary and volcanic rocks.

Geodes can form in any cavity, but the term is usually reserved for more or less rounded formations in igneous and sedimentary rocks.
