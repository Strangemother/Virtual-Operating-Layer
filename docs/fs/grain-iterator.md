# Pointer Stepping

Particle content is distributed across many spaces through the membrane. A Grain
must gather all owned particles in an ordely fashion for presentation. The particle
maintains no parents but the Grain must maintain the stepping procedure with the
correct details to access the particle of information through its given space.

A grain will step from 0 to _n_ until all _n_ is exausted. Through iteration the
grain will silently step through each space location and its ordered particles.
Once a particle has yielded its inforation the grain steps to the next expecting
particle. A user will see the incoming stream of ordered information without exposure
to the particle element.
