    Aggregate: A single unit containing grains. Access by a VOL session caller
    Grain: A single executable unit of an aggregate
    Particle: A container of bytes or binary for data access

+ Very large phenocrysts are termed megaphenocrysts
+ Applying particles to a grain is 'bonding' - as
+ agglomeration or agglomerate to create and bond particles.
+ combining many grains and particles to a single Phenocryst is Coalescence.
