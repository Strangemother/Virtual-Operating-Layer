# GNU?

It's known amongst the wizarding world, Linux was born of another child. The _first_ documented OS is PDP-7 in the 1970's picked up by Bell Labs. In 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in the higher-level language C which effectively became our platform today. Therefore I state we've become institutionalised by the language presented to us through computing history.

Linus openly applied the GNU/UNIX like interface to facilitate a process of adoption. And that's completely acceptable else humanity would not have become the genius technical intelligence we are today.

The goal of this research is to ask why, and is it really the only way forward. Over the decades we've seen technological advancement either dismissed or died slowly due to the disruptive nature. Some examples are ternary based memory, none-silcon cpus or even vastly different concepts/architectures.

I feel this is not of malice but more-so diligence upon the market or investors. Indeed we've seen many technologies ahead of their time; FPGA, Visual recognition, PDAs etc... all of which have slowly made a comeback, leveraging modern advancements within respective fields.

So what does that mean for GNU based OS's? As a whole the computing industry has paved a unified path whilst developing newer industry standards. We see this in software every day with the ye old standard `echo` and `print` commands.


## The Question

Replacing an entire industry isn't possible but serves as a nice thought experiment - what elements do we use each day, of which we simply accept as fact. And of those elements, how have we ascertained meaning, or applied conventions through skew-morph analogies. Firstly the term "file" and "folders" within a "directory". Or perhaps more-blunty - a "computer" - a human being capable of performing long computation math.

So I propose a re-brand and a rethink on all elements applied to a general operation system. I'd challenge the statement that most operating systems are actually a true distinct form of their implementation, without leveraging another OS. As such the community of _different os's_ are in fact skins and addons to the Linux Kernel. As a cursory tally, I count roughly 3? distinct kernels. Maybe 4...

For this project the goal is to build a distinctly new kernel incorporating todays capabilities at the core. With this we can redefine the core understand of interfacing with a system, questioning basic concepts such as "stdout", kernel page caching, to the depth of SATA instructions and CPU commands.
