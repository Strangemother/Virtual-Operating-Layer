# A Bunny [Rabbit]

In the philosohpy of irradicating unwanted code, this extends to easter-eggs and other _toy addons_. And although I enjoy the odd egg I don't feel it should be part of an end-user system or core functionality without the users' express permission.

The concept of an 'easter egg' promotes source reading; app hunting or general fun suprises but leads to built-in long-term potential painpoint.

Considering a simple easter egg to _pop an egg in the corner of the screen when the user presses F12 fives times_. It will likely involve interaction with internal layers:

+ Users Key states
+ visual binding
+ timing, micro data store etc...

In this case it could be a simple case of "print a png" and with that, the dev has stamped their fun - and the user awaits a fun surprise. But within a long-term base application, where does this lead?

The first question arises when integrating the code:

+ Who will own the egg and for how long
+ It is part of a _hidden_ package-set? Always waiting, or baked into a sythetic core
+ Bugs occur; is an egg important enough to halt a release?

As soon as an egg is created, it's begging to die. Thus - no baked easter-eggs.


## Commence Bunnies!

Sounds pretty boring and maybe someone _wants_ an egg. In this case the idea "bunnies", "a bunny" (extending the easter bunny + egg analogy) provides a layer/definition/implementation point for creating and accessing these _cute but stupid_ application.

Functionally a Bunny is the same as a standard application but it may run, it may not. It's wanted rarely, and does something fairly useless. If the bunny is unfunctional, it's removed without remorse.

This has a range of uses:

+ Easter eggs
+ "sample apps" or "micro demos"
+ "Dumb tools" and "Toys" - such as a _random squeaker_.
