# Meshing (A Membrane)


> A cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of living cells, physically separating the intracellular components from the extracellular environment.

A VOL membrane performs a similar role of transporting information across internal (A user space - cell) or extracellular (outside the user cell). A membrane is selectively permeable and able to regulate what enters and exits the cell.

> The cell membrane also plays a role in anchoring the cytoskeleton to provide shape to the cell, and in attaching to the extracellular matrix and other cells to hold them together to form tissues.

A VOL membrane bridges internal and external communications through a _shape_ bound by topology and instructionset - such as a Object store or SSH facility. Other active cells may communicate across a range of extra-cellular membranes, by stepping through membranes (e.g connecting two membranes through an extracelluar communication to a primary cell, to perform a _file_ write.)

All _units_ connected to the backbone assign a mesh. They gain a position within the topology and may contain their own subgraph, or inject a routine into the walking primary.

A membrane ferries data to other units, within cell structures or across exo-spaces. As membranes _connect things_ - they also define the _shape_ of the VOL and its overall abilities. In theory a main VOL is a small cpu - clustered with may clients across membranes.

A membrane maintains its own connectivity and protocol methods. It may also do event cleaning, and decide upon message transport methods, paths or reformatting.

Fundamentally a VOL unit may want to connect into the eco system, and say "Hey (in bluetooth), I want to become part of the system". The mesh responds and onboards the unit. The (bluetooth) membrane has access to other membranes. a membrane dedicated to event presentation may present a challenge - of which the user (or a layer within the eco-system) can respond. This process doesn't action the entire graph of units and only can segment the transation on a separate graph (a graph dedicated to hardware negotation)
