# Jetstream

When flying a craft you can reach a defined height given through capabilities of the engines. By default engines have a height ceiling, somewhat goverened by the "atmospheric pressure" of the envionment. In the first iteration this is a simple distance from the ground, with the engine loosing _pressure_ capacitity until further climbing cannot occur.

Through height a craft will be affect by psuedo weather system, affecting the flying stability and other factors. This includes (but is not limited to) wind effects, heavy rain, electronic effects. As the player progresses through a game the craft will reach the stratophere and beyond. As the player reaches the atmospheric edge, issues such as icing and depressurisation become new issues.

To traverse very long distances the game engine will simulate the flight across empty land-mass and oceans, periodically providing locations to pause. The player must be in control of the flight, either through manual flight or some sort of autopilot.

The default weather in the land-area is _nominimal_ on most days. At greater heights the weather becomes windy to severly stormy, until the user hits reaches above the clouds.

At a certain height the user may utilise the "jetstream" - a tunnel of fast air across the planet, connecting continent weather patterns. If a user wishes to traverse the massive distance, they may hop into the jetstream, speeding up the craft x3 and reducing engine engiry about by half or more.

Additionally, the control input will become soft, similar to a plane and its issues within a jetstream. The player will control the _balance_ of the craft in the center of the jetstream, ensuring a smooth and stable passage.  If the player tagents out of the stream, the transition is jarring and abrupt, tublimg and falling away from the airflow.
The player must gain control of the craft, and potentially attempt to rejoin the jetstream.
