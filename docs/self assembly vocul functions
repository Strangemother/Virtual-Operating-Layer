# Self Assembly Vocul Function + advancement.

It just hit me. More than 90% of my code is consistently the same mini algorthim rehashed with renamed vars.
As developers I think we all know this, however we persist with the natural course as I think we feel - as a generalisation - high-level languages are the fundemantal abstractions required to perform base-level computation.

To rephrase, languages like C, PHP, Python and Java are high-level. ASM (I can't think of others) is low-level. In higher-level languages we conform to a lot of C/ECMA standards noting `while`, `if` and `try`. Progressing to higher-level abstractions: collections, sets/_arrays_ and dictionaries. They are 101. Therefore with the tools given I can build operating systems, games and websites with the same dialect.

However over the years easily more than 10 core languages and millions of LoC, I've learnt my real core _experience_, is just remembering shit from 10 years ago... _Oh I need to correctly displace a vector on a globe for large scale mapping?_ Of course, I'll use StackOverflow question I googled correctly from 9 years ago. Perhaps I need to write a website. 6 years ago it would have taken 2 weeks for a polished site. Now it's hours - thanks to my quicker linux foo and remembering where my SFTP commands are...

How about all my senior knowledge? At work I'm considered the master in my team at Git, Python, Docker, HTML, CSS, JS etc.. And we see a general theme here... Long hours of reading. Nothing more that remembering the shite I broke. And so I've cracked the case - what is experience? A notebook and errors and a quicker reference than others.

Aside from my veil of humbility here one concept I build in another lifetime - self assembly vocul functions. It's a simple yet clever trick to expanding the lexicon of speech to a listening bot. Considering 8 years ago when I first coded the idea, it was a laughable experiment.

Simple concept:

    Me: Computer show me emails

Even back then this was a quick task to accomplish. With keyword detection "show" "emails". Next was extending to include any relative word to freely allow alterntive sentences referencing to the same action.

    Me: present new messages

At this point the computer gives up. however applying each word to a list of relative words, and scan for a nearest goal, the system can chack a small graph of associated words. By parsing a theasurus I gained enough of a lexicon to use a range of action phases for the same goal.

Importantly this was _self assembly_, so I didn't write every explicit action sentence to perform a task. Secondly, by interfacing with the code, I can read the function names and expected parameters. Therefore The system can determine the best goal by explicitly named functions.

    def send_email(to_person, subject, content):
        """Send an email to someone :to_person: about :subject:"""
        pass

Loading the function into the system provides the system with a root action 'email'.

    Me: send and email to derek about eggs
    PC: what is the content
    [diction mode]
    Me: blah blah blah

may change to

    ME: outbound message subject banana content this is a message about banana
    PC: What is the to person

it wasn't clever but it workeded somewhat.

Advancement.

For the VOL project there is a goal for a higherer-level language. By reducing the minutia of smaller references in favour of working with - grouped analogies for logical steps.

For example I've just written the a function for copying a dictionary; "Don't copy a key from A if key exists in B". Or perhaps clearer:

    1. Copy key:value from A to B
    2. If key exist in B; don't copy.
    3. return new dict.

The only unique feature of this code - opposed to all other identical functions I've created in the past - this has different argument names.

This extends to I feel every line of code I've created for the last 5 years. They should be applied at functional fundamentals. Allowing the usage in a nameless manner; essentially writing tiny snippets of code.

Given the correct input naming and a clever search method for the language construct, all logic may be broken into non-descriptive classes, methods, functions, stacks - without custom naming of every sub-element, because that's the way it's done.

---

It's a new paradigm presenting a less verbose coding methodology. Perhaps extending 'oop' with LSD micro transactions. Yet consider idea where a developer performs _ye old standard_ "loop, with a functional call - if the function exists in the scope". I feel this pseudo 20 lines could be a clever compiler string.

    results = loop (items) given (function) if (function) exists in (self)

the 'function' needn't be coded. It is another SSVF - perhaps creating URLS from all the objects created

    urls = loop (results) given (user options) creating formatted strings using (string formatting)


Embelishing this as a group of pseudo code:

    options = get cli args, env args, app args as a dictionary
    wanted urls = get csv rows from user options
    items = only wanted urls from urls in app or global options
    return = loop items given user options creating formatted strings using string templating

This represents a simple example of verbose terminolgy to display the analogy within our current convensions. However in this conceptual architecure, we do-away with _functions_ and classes and loops, in favour of larger facets of programing; extrapolting the functional layer - rather than using the abstracted machine layer.

Although not entirely possible as a complete solution, smaller components can be easily adapted. As a case this syntax isn't far from Cucumber testing. I see this vision as an extension of the same idea however applied to the core compiler as the standard language. In its thinnest form, it may be chunky batteries of code, specifically designed to be 'socialised' and implemented.

Plucking core functionality shouldn't be hard - adapting a language model to facilitate communication between 'modules' through a succinent construct is near impossible (for me). Considering alterntive options; ML chat box, a soft core lexicon (on the fly programmed), a sadie context net.

Initially all functionality could be functions named as batteries, with complex descriptions; pieced together by a clever bridge designed to understand how each module may fit. This is easy for thin logic, but for complicated structures introspection (runtime) may not be possible. However with an extremely thin dialect, fundamental language types are easy moved between modules. As such all 'modules' send and receive static types result objects; with functions for bridging aross all module types.

As an example a "loop" always expects an iterative type. And iterative type expects something to iterate.
