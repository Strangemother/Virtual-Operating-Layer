+ Initial random graph bits, to encrypt _within_.

    A range of initial keys after #0 as security _bits_. A chain sequence uncovered
    through a keypair decryprion yields a decrypt signature from graph keys.

the `root.lock()` method finalises the _current state_ of the bios and performs a test of the record. If false it should refuse to start.

## Bios Bits

Stored into an array the biod bits should act as protected keys for security models and valued data. Each key


## graph start points (CRC Execution)

As a single VOL kernel runs without pre-configuring, but contains all the assets required to boot, the input stream to initate the kernel may be _verified_ into the kernel through string testing. The CRC of the file denotes a key graph path. This emits across all signaling cpus; actioning the graph io and other init resources.

The CRC may act as a boot key sequence, allowing the graph to bridge an execution string, always starting with the identifier of CRC.

This should be coupled with some sort of stream encoder, else a bad-actor may simply edit the input file, record the CRC and alter the address bit within the memory. To avoid this the CRC should be randomised through the graph pre-bits.
