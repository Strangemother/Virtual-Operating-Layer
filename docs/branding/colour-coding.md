# color coding

Celestia VOL has a colour coded name. By default 'blue' is applied - because it's my favourite colour.

black - fully privatised; Could be airgapped.
blue - user owned / default
red - public
green - efficient / low power mode
white - unlocked/fully accessible and open/rooted

yellow - ... after red; currently nothing, maybe 'public mixed with white'
pink - ... after public - dunno
