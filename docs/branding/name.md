# The Name

Over the course of the project this has generally been referred to as "VOL" for virtual operating layer. And albeit accurate - it's a bit clinical. Through the search of a better name, I asked my new AI friend for a good suggestion. After some work we eventually settled on "Celestia [blue] OS".

The name "Celestia Blue" evokes the vision I'm attempting to achieve, with the thoughts of freedom, openness, and touches on the connectivity of the _graph_ like archiecture. Apparently.

_I_ really like it because it's the name of my late pet "Celeste". A fat blue exceptionally lazy cat that once put a vet in a hospital but was also bullied into submission by a magpie.

So I hope one day to install "Celestia Blue VOL" on a computering device. This will become Celestia Blue OS when running under its own kernel.
