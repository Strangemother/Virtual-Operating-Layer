# Noted Appliance

+ full CEF app

The full application of the core desktop extends into the CEF container. Producing
a complete platform with native integration.

The "VOL" (Virtual Operating Layer) is a GUI for rendering an app, designed [above]
with iso-morphic extensions for bridging core code into UI code.

With python, JS and a lot of clever the container (python local) serves a CEF
with an app driving the full implementation (JS, HTML). Applying bi-directional
application programming and layering all the concepts wanted.

# Purpose

A well-presented full UI layer to the scatter nux project. It will implement
all features for distributed application development, with a UI layer for
integrated environments and extended graphical development.

## Funz.

The core feature-set implements all the researched components for the Nux project.
Providing an open-source architecture for desktop-like applications on
a homogeneous platform.
